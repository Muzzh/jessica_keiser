              According to the naïve, pre-theoretic conception, lying seems to be characterized by the intent to deceive. However, certain kinds of bald-faced lies appear to be counterexamples to this view, and many philosophers have abandoned it as a result. I argue that this criticism of the naïve view is misplaced; bald-faced lies are not genuine instances of lying because they are not genuine instances of assertion. I present an additional consideration in favor of the naïve view, which is that abandoning it comes at an extremely high price; alternative accounts which eschew the intent-to-deceive condition on lying have difficulty distinguishing lies from non-literal speech

              Linguistic meaning is determined by use. But given the fact that any given expression can be used in a variety of ways, this claim marks where metasemantic inquiry begins rather than where it ends. It sets an agenda for the metasemantic project: to distinguish in a principled and explanatory way those uses that determine linguistic meaning from those that do not. The prevailing view (along with its various refinements), which privileges assertion, suffers from being at once overly liberal and overly idealized. By parsing the most prominent aims we use language to achieve, noting their relations of dependence and the specific type of uses they involve, I arrive at a novel metasemantic account: facts of linguistic meaning are determined by locutionary action.

              In Imagination and Convention: Distinguishing Grammar and Inference in Language, Matthew Stone and Ernie Lepore offer a multifaceted critique of the widely influential Gricean picture of language use, proposing in its place a novel framework within which to understand the role of convention in linguistic communication. They criticize Lewis’ and Grice’s commitment to what they call prospective intentionalism, according to which the meaning of an utterance is determined by the effects that the speaker intends it to have on the conversation. Instead, they make a case for what they call direct intentionalism, according to which the meaning of an utterance is determined by the speaker’s intentions to use it in under a certain grammatical analysis. I argue that there is an equivocation behind their critique, both regarding the type of meaning that is at issue, and with respect to the question each theory is attempting to answer; once we parse these issues apart, we find that Stone and Lepore’s main contentions are compatible with the broadly Lewisian/Gricean picture.

              Why should we think that there is a unique epistemic norm of assertion in the face of contextual variation on judgments of propriety? This position would be motivated, I suggest, only by an independent commitment to the idea that the norm of assertion must be constitutive of that act. I argue that such a commitment is misplaced, as constitutive theories fail to discharge the explanatory task of a full theory of assertion. I propose a non-constitutive account of assertion rooted in a broader theory of communication, language, and speech acts, demonstrating that it is preferable on broad theoretical grounds as well as in explanatory force. I show that this account predicts the contextual variation on epistemic norms that must be explained away by constitutive accounts.

              In his seminal 1948 essay “Meaning”, H.P. Grice launched a fruitful program that continues to shape how linguists and philosophers theorize about language and language use. Though there are many facets to Grice’s theory of communication, we can characterize the broader project as that of reducing linguistic phenomena to facts about the mental states and actions of language users. Though many aspects of the Gricean picture of language retain a foothold in linguistic theory, this broader project has fallen out of fashion in recent years as criticisms of specific implementations have given way to a pessimism about its overall viability. This paper is an attempt to breathe life back into this program and to show that various problems find their source in specific implementations of the project rather than in the project itself. In particular, I will show that many of these problems are dissolved when certain idealizations are relaxed. Moreover, the relaxation of these idealizations gives way to more flexibility in providing a “synthesis”, as David Lewis put it, between one conception of language as an abstract semantic system and another conception of language as deeply rooted in the messy, fluctuating world of human affairs. Finally, this paper is an attempt to carry out the reductive project farther than did those from whom it was inherited; I propose a reduction that is comprehensive, extending its scope to language use as well as to languages themselves.
