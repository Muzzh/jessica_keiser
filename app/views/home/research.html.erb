            This paper defends the use-based metasemantic project against the problem of meaning without use, which allegedly shows the predictions of use-based metasemantic accounts to be indeterminate with respect to unusably long or complex expressions. This criticism is commonly taken to be decisive, prompting various retreats and contributing to the project’s eventual decline. Using metasemantic conventionalism as a case study, I argue the following: either such expressions do not belong to used languages or their meanings are uniquely determined by use. Thus, the alleged problem of meaning without use offers no challenge to the use-based metasemantic project generally, nor to conventionalism in particular.

            This paper attempts to revive a once-lively program in the philosophy of language—that of reducing linguistic phenomena to facts about mental states and actions. I argue that recent skepticism toward this project is generated by features of traditional implementations of the project, rather than the project itself. A picture of language as essentially a mechanism for cooperative information exchange attracted theorists to metasemantic accounts grounding language use in illocutionary action (roughly, using an utterance to elicit a propositional attitude). When this picture is rejected, a metasemantics grounding language in locutionary action (using an utterance to direct attention) emerges as a more viable proposal, dissolving an intractable issue for traditional theories: the metasemantics of subsentential expressions.

            According to the naïve, pre-theoretic conception, lying seems to be characterized by the intent to deceive. However, certain kinds of bald-faced lies appear to be counterexamples to this view, and many philosophers have abandoned it as a result. I argue that this criticism of the naïve view is misplaced; bald-faced lies are not genuine instances of lying because they are not genuine instances of assertion. I present an additional consideration in favor of the naïve view, which is that abandoning it comes at an extremely high price; alternative accounts which eschew the intent-to-deceive condition on lying have difficulty distinguishing lies from non-literal speech

            Linguistic meaning is determined by use. But given the fact that any given expression can be used in a variety of ways, this claim marks where metasemantic inquiry begins rather than where it ends. It sets an agenda for the metasemantic project: to distinguish in a principled and explanatory way those uses that determine linguistic meaning from those that do not. The prevailing view (along with its various refinements), which privileges assertion, suffers from being at once overly liberal and overly idealized. By parsing the most prominent aims we use language to achieve, noting their relations of dependence and the specific type of uses they involve, I arrive at a novel metasemantic account: facts of linguistic meaning are determined by locutionary action.

            In Imagination and Convention: Distinguishing Grammar and Inference in Language, Matthew Stone and Ernie Lepore offer a multifaceted critique of the widely influential Gricean picture of language use, proposing in its place a novel framework within which to understand the role of convention in linguistic communication. They criticize Lewis’ and Grice’s commitment to what they call prospective intentionalism, according to which the meaning of an utterance is determined by the effects that the speaker intends it to have on the conversation. Instead, they make a case for what they call direct intentionalism, according to which the meaning of an utterance is determined by the speaker’s intentions to use it in under a certain grammatical analysis. I argue that there is an equivocation behind their critique, both regarding the type of meaning that is at issue, and with respect to the question each theory is attempting to answer; once we parse these issues apart, we find that Stone and Lepore’s main contentions are compatible with the broadly Lewisian/Gricean picture.

            A number of puzzles arise in connection with providing an ontology of linguistic entities, many of which share a common feature: they are manifestations of a more general problem, aptly characterized by David Lewis as a tension between two apparently conflicting conceptions of language. On the one hand, our best theories model languages as abstract semantic systems. On the other, we think of languages as changing social constructs—both grounded in, and grounding, various social relations and institutions of human beings. Lewis attempted to provide a “synthesis” between these conceptions by showing that identifying languages abstract semantic systems is compatible with the contingent and socially determined fact that we speak certain languages rather than others. Other elements of the desired synthesis, however remain problematic; in particular, Lewis’ set-theoretic conception of linguistic expressions and linguistic communities appears to be incompatible with our conception of language as a changing social construct because it apparently lacks the resources to deal with data involving (1) change, (2) contingency, and (3) variety, By both building on—and at times modifying—Lewis’ theory, I show that his general metasemantic framework can be extended to accommodate these difficulties.

              The Case for Consent Pluralism
            </h5>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            A longstanding debate regarding the nature of consent has marked a tri-fold division among philosophical and legal theorists according to whether they take consent to be a type of mental state, a form of behaviour, or some hybrid of the two. Theorists on all sides acknowledge that ordinary language cannot serve as a guide to resolving this ontological question, given the polysemy of the word “consent” in ordinary language. Similar observations have been noted about the function of consent in the law and use of the word “consent” in legal contexts. This paper makes a parallel argument regarding consent’s characteristic normative role: roughly, to transform moral prohibitions into permissions. This role is neither unique nor essential to any one particular kind of thing, be it a mental state, form of behaviour, or hybrid of the two—rather, it is played by mental states and behaviour in independent and context-sensitive ways. The upshot is that insofar as we are interested in its normative implications, we ought to adopt a pluralistic approach to consent which gives independent weight to the moral contributions of facts about mental states and facts about behaviour relative to a context.

            Constitutive norm theorists take the epistemic norm of assertion to be constitutive of that speech act. The implicit methodology behind this approach normativity-first; if we can correctly identify the norm(s) of assertion, then—filling in some additional details—its metaphysics will follow. The thriving literature on constitutive epistemic norms, however, has failed to make good on this promissory note; it is simply taken on faith that an adequate metaphysics could be developed. I argue that such optimism has been unwarranted. If the constitutive norm approach is to be a serious competitor to the more traditional approach—according to which the epistemic norm of assertion is derived from general norms--it must be shown that there is some viable way of developing a metaphysics of assertion which preserves its core commitments.
