    <p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Philosophy at Yale University. My primary area of research is the philosophy of language, though I also have interests in metaphysics, logic, the philosophy of art, and feminist philosophy. My dissertation, supervised by Zoltán Szabó, is about linguistic convention.</p>

          According to the naïve, pre-theoretic conception, lying seems to be characterized by the intent to deceive. However, certain kinds of bald-faced lies appear to be counterexamples to this view, and many philosophers have abandoned it as a result. I argue that this criticism of the naïve view is misplaced; bald-faced lies are not genuine instances of lying because they are not genuine instances of assertion. I present an additional consideration in favor of the naïve view, which is that abandoning it comes at an extremely high price; alternative accounts which eschew the intent-to-deceive condition on lying have difficulty distinguishing lies from non-literal speech

          Linguistic meaning is determined by use. But given the fact that any given expression can be used in a variety of ways, this claim marks where metasemantic inquiry begins rather than where it ends. It sets an agenda for the metasemantic project: to distinguish in a principled and explanatory way those uses that determine linguistic meaning from those that do not. The prevailing view (along with its various refinements), which privileges assertion, suffers from being at once overly liberal and overly idealized. By parsing the most prominent aims we use language to achieve, noting their relations of dependence and the specific type of uses they involve, I arrive at a novel metasemantic account: facts of linguistic meaning are determined by locutionary action.

          In Imagination and Convention: Distinguishing Grammar and Inference in Language, Matthew Stone and Ernie Lepore offer a multifaceted critique of the widely influential Gricean picture of language use, proposing in its place a novel framework within which to understand the role of convention in linguistic communication. They criticize Lewis’ and Grice’s commitment to what they call prospective intentionalism, according to which the meaning of an utterance is determined by the effects that the speaker intends it to have on the conversation. Instead, they make a case for what they call direct intentionalism, according to which the meaning of an utterance is determined by the speaker’s intentions to use it in under a certain grammatical analysis. I argue that there is an equivocation behind their critique, both regarding the type of meaning that is at issue, and with respect to the question each theory is attempting to answer; once we parse these issues apart, we find that Stone and Lepore’s main contentions are compatible with the broadly Lewisian/Gricean picture.

          The current state of the literature concerning the epistemic normativity of assertion is unlikely to be advanced solely by appeal to judgments about propriety; rather, at this stage of the debate theoretical considerations are needed to adjudicate between rival accounts. In particular, much hinges on whether the norm of assertion is constitutive of that act. Though constitutive norm theories enjoy wide popularity for their ability to judgments of propriety, I argue that they fail to discharge the explanatory task of a full theory of assertion. I propose a non-constitutive account of assertion rooted in a broader theory of communication, language, and speech acts, demonstrating that it is preferable on broad theoretical grounds as well as in explanatory and predictive force
