      <p>I will be a postdoctoral research fellow in philosophy at the Centre for Consciousness at the Australian National University during the 2017-2018 academic year.</p>

      <p>Before joining the department at ANU, I studied at Yale University (Ph.D. expected December 2017) under the supervision of Zoltán Szabó. My research focuses on the nature of language and convention. I also have interests in metaphysics, the philosophy of art, the philosophy of law, and feminist philosophy.</p>
